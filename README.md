# Quick Editor package
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Maushundb/quick-editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Maushundb/quick-editor)

Quickly select and edit CSS/LESS/SCSS styles from the context of your markdown instead of cluttering up your coding environment with extra panes.
Inspired by [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)'s quick edit feature.
